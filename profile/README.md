# ATF-Tuner – Auto-Tuning Framework

This GitHub organization hosts the **Auto-Tuning Framework (ATF)** and related tools.
ATF is a research-driven framework for automatically tuning performance-critical program parameters.

The repositories in this organization provide language bindings, libraries, and
infrastructure to integrate auto-tuning into real-world systems.

---

## Scope

ATF focuses on:

- automatic exploration of performance parameter spaces,
- support for constrained tuning parameters,
- integration into existing applications and toolchains,
- portability across platforms and execution environments.

The projects here are primarily research-oriented, but aim to be usable and extensible in practice.
